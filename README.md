# ScrollOdometer

Have you ever wondered how much you really scroll? I got curious about my own habits, so I built this small app to measure the distance in meters or even kilometers.
It turns out that it's easy to scroll through hundreds of meters of content without even noticing!

It is a mockup social media app not intended for distribution. I simulated the randomized feed and added an odometer to it.
